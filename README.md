## Architecture

### Libraries
We're using React.js to compartmentalize the application, and also to make React Router available to us. We're planning to use Redux for storing the in-game information in global state, like current players, score, and who's in the graveyard.

We need a backend framework, and since we don't really know any better, we're going to use MongoDB with Mongoose and Express.
